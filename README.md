# Dijkstra Algorithm #

C++ implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

The code has been cleaned up and is much easier to use now.


## TODO ##

Write adapters to take a graph in either link structure, adjacency
list or matrix form and create the necessary graph inforamation to run
the algorithm over.
